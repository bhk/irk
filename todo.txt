         defer(_ => f(a,b))  <-->   defer(f, a, b)
    * Remove deferMemo
         deferMemo(f)(a,b)    -->   defer(memo(f), a,b)
 - i.js: Document "monitoring": "during execution of a cell, its accesses of
   other cells (inputs, intermediates) are logged."

Notes
=====

 * `$ npm update` installs dependencies.

 * Javascript sources are ES "modules", and should be directly usable,
   as-is, by a browser or Node.js.  This implies:

   - Imports must use relative paths beginning with "./" or "../".
     (Browsers require this -- or "/", which would mean different things in
     different contexts.)

   - We add `"type":"module"` to package.json so Node will recognize them
     as such.

 * `./test.js` is remapped to `./no-test.js` when bulding bundles for the
   browser.  With minification, this also discards embedded unit tests.
